🌌 Aeon HQ

Secure identity. Modular systems. Modern infrastructure.

Aeon builds a new generation of tools focused on security, clarity and long-term maintainability. Our ecosystem starts with a strong identity layer and extends into modular business systems and infrastructure.

⸻

🔐 Aeon ID

Aeon ID is a new identity architecture designed from scratch. It relies on a local-first cryptographic model, predictable flows and a clean internal structure — not on legacy authentication methods.

It serves as the trust layer for everything in the Aeon ecosystem.

➡️ Repository: aeon-id (public) ➡️ Core engine: aeon-id-core (private)

⸻

🏢 Aeon ERP

Aeon ERP is the operational backbone of the platform. It aims to provide a modern, modular and understandable ERP foundation that avoids the complexity, rigidity and opacity of traditional systems.

Identity, permissions and sensitive actions are handled directly through Aeon ID.

🔒 Aeon Vault (upcoming)

Encrypted storage and key-management layer built for sensitive data and secure workflows.

⸻

⛓️ Aeon Chain (upcoming)

Lightweight modular chain designed for business logic, auditability and identity-backed operations.

⸻

☁️ Aeon Cloud (upcoming)

Infrastructure built around identity, privacy and modular deployment.

🧭 Vision

Aeon aims to provide a consistent, secure and understandable foundation for modern software. We don’t combine existing technologies — we design architectures from the ground up with a focus on: • clarity • strong identity guarantees • predictable behavior • modular growth • long-term maintainability

Our identity layer powers the ERP. The ERP powers the applications. And the whole ecosystem rests on a secure and coherent model.
